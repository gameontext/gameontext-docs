Kate and I took Game On! to [OSCon London](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-eu/public/schedule/detail/53521)! We spoke about our experiences building the game, and Kate created a new room in Java from scratch and showed the game finding the room, and coping as the service recycled in response to updates.

<p>We met all kinds of nice people, including Casey West, Dawn Foster, and Lorna Mitchell.</p>
