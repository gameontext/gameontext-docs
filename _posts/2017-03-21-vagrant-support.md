Setting up the core game services locally can be a tricky business. If you don't fancy [installing our core game services and dependencies](https://book.gameontext.org/walkthroughs/local-docker.html) on your most favorite dev box, have a look at our [Vagrant](https://github.com/gameontext/gameon-vagrant) project, which will set up a virtual machine ready for local development.

Go play!
