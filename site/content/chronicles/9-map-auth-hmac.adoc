We added {signedHeaders}[signed header-based security] to the Map service APIs.

Adding security after the fact is a bad idea. Just sayin'. We managed it, but it
was messy, and required coordinated rollouts across our services to get the support
for Signed JWTs and signed HMACs working the way we wanted.

The {sharedLibrary}[shared library] we built for managing signature verification
did make this easier for Java.
