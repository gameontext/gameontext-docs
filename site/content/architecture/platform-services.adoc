== Amalgam8 services.

Amalgam8 supplies us a Registry, and a Controller, via which it implements the
Service Discovery, and Service Proxying that we make use of in our core services.

== Kafka/MessageHub

We have started adding event driven processing to the Game On core services, and
Kafka (also used by Amalgam8) is our chosen Publish/Subscribe solution.

== etcd

Etcd was added to simplify configuration management. There are many ways to
slice this particular onion, but the important thing for us was being able to see the
configuration attributes used, and in some cases shared, by our core services
in a central place.

The configuration attributes stored in etcd are environment-specific: different
values are provided for different deployment stages using isolated etcd clusters.
Etcd is not used when developing locally, we instead rely on local env files
injected via Docker Compose.
