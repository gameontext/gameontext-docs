== Swagger

A simple process that serves the swagger UI with our {swagger}[swagger API documents].

== Room implementations

We have a few room implementations defined within our repositories.

* {simpleroom}[SimpleRoom] -- foundation for the Java-based walkthrough
* {nodejsroom}[Node.js room] -- foundation for the JavaScript walkthrough
* {goroom}[Go room] -- foundation for the Go walkthrough
* {recroom}[The RecRoom and Basement] -- two related rooms, one of which has items
* {maproom}[The Map room] -- uses the Map's API to display a map of all registered rooms

For most of them, a single service is providing a single room. The notable
exception is the RecRoom and Basement, where a single service is providing two
related rooms.

Each service is responsible for managing its own data (if any), and satisfying the
published APIs for a room to the satisfaction of the Sweep. As mentioned in
{walkthroughs}[Extending the game], rooms are what allow you to
experiment with microservices concepts and approaches. In effect you are building
one microservice (or a subsystem composed of microservices) that becomes one element
of a larger system of services. You can play in and with a microservices
architecture without having to build all of the pieces yourself.
