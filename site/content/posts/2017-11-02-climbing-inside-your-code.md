Long long ago, in a land far far away (also known as QCon San Francisco, 2016), I met John Voorhees and Avik Das from [Primitive](http://primitive.io/), a small startup building VR tools that allow you to visualize your code in an immersive way.

We were also talking about Game On!, because we're about helping you experiment with new technologies and concepts in a differently immersive way.

They scanned and built a visualization of the core game services, and brought it to JavaOne! Check it out, it is seriously cool stuff.
