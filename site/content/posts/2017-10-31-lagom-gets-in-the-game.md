JavaOne was a month ago! No way! Time sure flies. 

Our lab with Lightbend was an excellent adventure, complete with the exciting, heart-pounding, last-minute rush to get the materials working end to end. I don't know about you, but that last minute hacking stuff is why I love what I do. 

I enjoyed working with the Lightbenders; they're a great team, with solid ideas around how to build reactive applications. What we demonstrated in the lab barely scratched the surface of what you can do with their framework. If you're curious, you can check out the [lab materials](https://github.com/lagom/lagom-gameon-maven-archetype), but expect some new advanced adventures to grow out of this modest beginning.

Hugh and I had a blast talking to developers the booth, and generally being ridiculous. So much fun!
