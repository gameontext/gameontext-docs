Kate and I took Game On! to [OSCon London](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-eu/public/schedule/detail/53521)! We spoke about our experiences building the game, and Kate created a new room in Java from scratch and showed the game finding the room, and coping as the service recycled in response to updates.

We met all kinds of nice people, including Casey West, Dawn Foster, and Lorna Mitchell.
