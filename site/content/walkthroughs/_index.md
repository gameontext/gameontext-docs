As has been mentioned, this game was built to be extended.

Creating rooms or non-player characters or quantum-entangled items is not
really the point, though it has the advantage of giving you something to build
that isn't so closely related to traditional patterns you already know.

The point is for you to experiment with microservice architectures and strategies
for building resilient distributed systems. We have some walkthroughs to get
you started:

{{< dl >}}
{{< dt >}}[Create a new room]({{< relref "createRoom.md" >}}){{< /dl >}}
{{< dd >}}Create and deploy your own services! Containers or build packs, kubernetes or cloud foundry. 
What about Heroku? Whatever you're curious about, this is a perfect way to play.{{< /dd >}}

{{< dt >}}[Choose your own adventure]({{< relref "advanced/_index.adoc" >}}){{< /dt >}}
{{< dd >}}Choose from a list of follow-on activities to improve the scalability and
resilience of your room, or to create new inter-service interaction patterns.{{< /dd >}}
