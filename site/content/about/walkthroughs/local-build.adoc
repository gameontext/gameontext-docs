Developing and testing your room locally in a production-like environment is an
important aspect of {12-factor}[Twelve factor applications], as it reduces the
likelihood that what you create locally will fail in new and unexpected ways
when activated in production.

Game On! is a containerized application that uses replaceable backing services
that can also run locally in containers (sometimes with minor substitutions,
as we'll see). We like this for two reasons: 1) we can directly see what happens
when we prod things with a stick, and 2) we can be much more destructive with
local copies without worrying about messing something up.

== Using Vagrant

The Vagrantfile defined in the {root}[gameontext/gameon] (root) project will ensure that you're
using the right versions of everything, regardless of which orchestration engine
you use, at the cost of getting one version right.

You need at least version 1.9.8 of Vagrant, which you can install using packages
from the {vagrant}[Vagrant downloads page].

Once you have Vagrant installed:

1. Use `vagrant up` to provision and launch the Vagrant VM.
2. Use `vagrant ssh` to create a command shell in the VM
  * *All commands in the following sections are run in this shell*
  * You will start in the `/vagrant` directory
    - This directory is 'shared'
    - It is the directory containing the Vagrantfile (the root `gameon` project)
3. When you're done, use `vagrant down` to stop the VM.
4. Use `vagrant destroy` to tear down the VM completely.

== Using Docker

{docker}[Installation instructions] for Docker vary by platform. On Windows and
macOS, you can also choose between Docker native and Docker Toolbox. Both should work.

We provide {dockerhub}[pre-built images on dockerhub] to simplify the steps
required to run the game locally.

== Container orchestration

For sanity, you need help of some kind to manage starting and stopping images.
Even with the orchestrators, we still wrap invocations with shell scripts:
the scripts help ensure we all issue the same commands the same way every time.

* {using-compose}[Using Docker Compose]
* {using-kubernetes}[Using Kubernetes]

NOTE: The following sections apply to both Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
Use `./go-admin.sh choose` to toggle between them. The default value is `docker`
(to indicate Docker Compose).

== Starting game services locally (TL;DR)

1. Obtain the source for the root project ({root}[gameontext/gameon])
  * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/gameontext/gameon.git`
  * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:gameontext/gameon.git`

2. Change to the gameon directory
+
-------------------------------------------
$ cd gameon
-------------------------------------------
3. Setup your environment (one time).
+
-------------------------------------------
$ ./go-admin.sh choose       # choose Docker Compose or Kubernetes
$ eval $(./go-admin.sh env)  # set aliases for admin scripts
$ alias go-run               # confirm `go-run.sh` script location
-------------------------------------------
4. Set up core game services:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run setup
-------------------------------------------
5. Start core game services:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run up
-------------------------------------------
6. *Carry on with {adventures}[building your room] or other adventures*

7. Clean up
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run down
-------------------------------------------


== Modifying Core Game services

If you change your mind, and decide you want to start hacking on a core game
service, no worries! You can mix and match the two approaches.

We use {git}[git submodules] to allow editing of core game services while
working with the {root}[gameontext/gameon] (root) project to coordinate
deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using {git}[git submodules], please do not commit any changes to submodule
versions. Submodule versions are maintained by automated builds.
====

The following instructions assume you've cloned the root repository,
and are interested in editing the `map` service as an example:

1. Change to the gameon directory
+
-------------------------------------------
cd gameon
-------------------------------------------
2. Obtain the source for the project that you want to change.
+
-------------------------------------------
git submodule init map
git submodule update map
-------------------------------------------
3. Make your changes from within the child directory
+
-------------------------------------------
cd map
git checkout -b newbranch
-------------------------------------------
Then edit source or docker/image files using your favorite IDE.
+
TIP: If you plan to edit projects with Eclipse, run `./bin/eclipse.sh` to generate eclipse project files.

4. Compile the source and rebuild docker image
* <<local-docker.adoc#rebuild,Rebuild with Docker Compose>>
* <<local-kubernetes.adoc#rebuild,Rebuild with Kubernetes>>

5. Push your changes to a new branch. From the map directory:
+
-------------------------------------------
git add -u
git commit -s
-------------------------------------------
+
[NOTE]
====
Git commits must be {contribute}[signed]
====
Once you make your commit, if you go back to the root directory, you will see
a pending change for map. This indicates that the submodule is different than
the version from the current branch of the root project. *Do not
check in this change.* Sadly, these files can not be added to `.gitignore`.
+
Care must be taken to avoid staging these files if you otherwise end up making
changes to files in the root project itself.

== Notes

=== Supporting 3rd party auth

3rd party authentication (twitter, github, etc.) will not work locally, but the
anonymous/dummy user will. If you want to test with one of the 3rd party
authentication providers, you'll need to
{sociallogin}[set up your own tokens to do so.]
