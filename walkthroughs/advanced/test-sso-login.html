I thought this section was for Game On?</p><p>Game On allows players to identify themselves via third party services, such as
Facebook, Twitter, etc. These are examples of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login>'Social Login'</a>,
where a user can use credentials they have with an existing service, to sign
into a new application (Game On).</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_how_does_this_work>How does this work ?</h2><p>When a user accesses Game On, they are offered a choice of which Social Login
they wish to use, when they select an option, Game On has their browser head to
the appropriate service login page, where they sign in, the browser then returns
to Game On after the authentication.</p><p>Behind the scenes, when Game On forwards to the social login page, Game On has
to identify itself to that service, most use a variant of <a href=https://oauth.net/2/>OAuth-2.0</a>.
Just as Game On wants to trust that the user has authenticated themselves with
the remote social login service, the remote service needs to know it&#8217;s only
performing that task for someone it trusts too.</p><p>In each case, that reverse trust is managed by the creation of an application
with the remote service, the application acting as Game On&#8217;s authorization to
use the remote service for login purposes.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_why_do_i_need_my_own_social_login_apps>Why do I need my own Social Login apps ?</h2><p>Given that Game On already clearly has these apps configured when you use it
today, why do you need your own apps when running Game On locally?</p><p>As part of an app definition, you have to tell the app where to send the user
after the user has authenticated. After all, Game On sent the user to the social
login service, the service has to send them back. The apps we already have are
configured to send the user back to the live running Game On servers. If you
were to configure them locally, and connect to your local Game On, after
authentication, you&#8217;d be connected to the live Game On.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_adding_your_own_social_login_app_facebook>Adding your own Social Login app (Facebook).</h2><p>As a start we&#8217;ll explain how to add just one social login app for local testing,
Facebook. Adding the other services follow a similar process, hopefully that may
make a bit more sense after you&#8217;ve seen how to configure the Facebook one.</p><p>Start by heading to the <a href=https://developers.facebook.com/>Facebook developer page</a></p><p>There.. select 'my apps' at the top right of the page, and then 'add an app'
then select 'website' as the type of app, then give it a name eg 'My Local
GameOn Testing App'.. then skip the rest of the wizard thing..</p><p>From here the instructions will get a little sketchy, because really this needs
a whole bunh of screengrabs, but I can&#8217;t get those done at the mo.. so here&#8217;s
the rough info you need in the meantime</p><p>(please just imagine the screengrabs, being held attractively by suitably clad
assistants, smiling at the camera, while remonstrating expressively with their
hands toward said screengrabs, alternatively, send me the screengrabs via our
slack channel, and I&#8217;ll add them here.. )</p><p>You&#8217;ll need to grab your 'App ID' .. and the 'App Secret' those are the entries
you&#8217;ll need to put in your <a href=https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/gameon.env>gameon.env</a> file. (In the
FACEBOOK_APP_ID and FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET vars)</p><p>But we&#8217;re not done yet, we have to sort out a few other bits, and the easiest
place to sort all this is from the 'Settings' panel on the left side (below
'Dashboard').</p><p>From there you can also get that 'App ID', 'App Secret', and you need to configure..</p><div class=ulist><ul><li>Display Name, thats the one that wil show up when people click 'Facebook'
to tell them what they are signing into.</li><li>App Domains, here you need to put in 127.0.0.1, or 192.168.x.x, what ever
address you access your local game on at.</li><li>PrivacyPolicy / TermsOfService URLs, (may be required for facebook, to access
email.. ) just use "https://gameontext.org/#/terms"</li><li>Site URL, this also needs to be configured to have the domain of wherever
your local Game On is running.. eg, <a class=bare href=http://127.0.0.1/>http://127.0.0.1/</a> or <a class=bare href=http://192.168.x.x/>http://192.168.x.x/</a></li></ul></div></section></article><nav class=prev-next><div class=nav-left><div class=long><a href=/walkthroughs/advanced/istio.html title="Previous: Istio and Kubernetes">Istio and Kubernetes</a></div><div class=short><a href=/walkthroughs/advanced/istio.html title="Previous: Istio and Kubernetes">Previous</a></div></div><div class=nav-center><div class=long>Up: <a href=/walkthroughs/advanced/>Advanced Adventures</a></div><div class=short><a href=/walkthroughs/advanced/>Up</a></div></div><div class=nav-right><div class=long><a href=/walkthroughs/advanced/room-from-scratch.html title="Next: Create a room from scratch">Create a room from scratch</a></div><div class=short><a href=/walkthroughs/advanced/room-from-scratch.html title="Next: Create a room from scratch">Next</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class=foot><div id=copyrights>&#169; 2016-2020 under terms of the Apache License 2.0.</div><div>Follow us:
