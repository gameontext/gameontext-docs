This work partly builds on an earlier attempt to bring Game On! to Kubernetes back in May last year. We learnt a few lessons from that attempt, and like to think this attempt is a little cleaner.</description></item><item><title>Simplified Docker Compose for local development</title><link>/2017/09/22/simplified-docker-compose-for-local-development.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/09/22/simplified-docker-compose-for-local-development.html</guid><description>We now have a special branch in the gameon repository that contains a snapshot of a smooth end-to-end local development flow with docker-compose.

Yes, yes. Kubernetes is next, we promise. But with this revision of the Docker Compose path, we dropped a lot of complexity (bye, Amalgam8!) and created a simplified path for getting started.</description></item><item><title>Local development with Vagrant</title><link>/2017/03/21/vagrant-support.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/21/vagrant-support.html</guid><description>Setting up the core game services locally can be a tricky business. If you don't fancy installing our core game services and dependencies on your most favorite dev box, have a look at our Vagrant project clone the gameon repository, cd gameon, and run vagrant up, which will set up a virtual machine ready for local development.
Go play!
*Edit 2017-09-13: As noted above, using Vagrant for local development is now even easier.</description></item></channel></rss>
