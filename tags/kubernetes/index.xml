So our resident techno-wizards have come up with a pile of scripts to help orchestrate the deploy onto K8S, and do some of the config and setup and boring backgroundy stuff that's required to get a polyglot microservice app up and running in your cluster.</description></item><item><title>Moving GameOn to Kubernetes</title><link>/2018/01/11/gameon-kubernetes.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/01/11/gameon-kubernetes.html</guid><description>Game On! and Kubernetes Here at Game On! central, we've been considering how to run on Kubernetes for quite some time, and during a pause in the recent Holiday Season, we had a chance to add Kubernetes support allowing you to run the core services locally.
This work partly builds on an earlier attempt to bring Game On! to Kubernetes back in May last year. We learnt a few lessons from that attempt, and like to think this attempt is a little cleaner.</description></item></channel></rss>
