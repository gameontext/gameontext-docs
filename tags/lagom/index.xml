No way! Time sure flies.
Our lab with Lightbend was an excellent adventure, complete with the exciting, heart-pounding, last-minute rush to get the materials working end to end. I don't know about you, but that last minute hacking stuff is why I love what I do.
I enjoyed working with the Lightbenders; they're a great team, with solid ideas around how to build reactive applications. What we demonstrated in the lab barely scratched the surface of what you can do with their framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
